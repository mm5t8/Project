## Welcome, I am Michael Moran

I am a student at the University of Missouri. This website is for infotc_1000 final project where we are to make a website about ourselves in githubpages with markdown. This website will serve as an overview of who I am, and what I like to do. Furthermore, there is some comedic flavor, so I hope you enjoy!
